## About

This is a to-do list/event calendar application to exercise basic Node.js principles like Express, mongodb, mongoose, EJS, etc. The site is in working condition, though it is far from complete.

**I encourage reading through about page** to discover all current functions until I upgrade the site to its full potential.

### Current Version 1.1.0;

In the current version I implemented a simple username validation using express-session and passport-local-mongoose in order to display only tasks that belong to client.

You can register an account and navigate between year, months and days.

### Next Versions

* Years page will show each months days in their boxes, this numbers will display the number of completed or failed or pending tasks status using an color spectrum. Which means completed tasks although they are removed from the database they will trigger a counter.
* Each task can be set with an hour option, The tasks displayed in each day will be sorted by hour.
* A public event system where you can create event and display them in an public environment that can be reached through navbar
* A profile page that shows a bulletin board view for tasks or notes that doesn't have a certain day but more like a future plan.
* The profile page can display bulletin board, tasks and event in separate sections.

These are the ones that I currently remember, enjoy the application and I very welcome any comments regarding the coding.
